## Summary
A stylized VR experience that utilizes Quest 2 handtracking to learn about traditional Japanese tools and techniques for sushi with a light-hearted story.

## 🎯 Project Aim + Goal
The aim of this VR experience is to provide users with an engaging and entertaining way to learn about traditional Japanese tools and techniques for sushi-making while enjoying a light-hearted and humorous storyline. Utilizing Quest 2 hand tracking, users will interact with custom-designed hand tracking events and slicing mechanics, immersing themselves in a stylistic and visually pleasing environment. Through 3D assets and custom animations, users will go through five handcrafted "stages," participating in two sushi-making lessons that involve slicing fish for nigiri and forming and presenting nigiri. The project's pillars are centered around accurate hand-tracking interactions, a light-hearted tone, an educational experience about Japanese sushi-making, and captivating aesthetics.
