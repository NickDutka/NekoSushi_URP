## <p align="center">Summary<p align="center">
A stylized VR experience that utilizes Quest 2 handtracking to learn about traditional Japanese tools and techniques for sushi with a light-hearted story.

## 🎯 Project Aim + Goal
The aim of this VR experience is to provide users with an engaging and entertaining way to learn about traditional Japanese tools and techniques for sushi-making while enjoying a light-hearted and humorous storyline. Utilizing Quest 2 hand tracking, users will interact with custom-designed hand tracking events and slicing mechanics, immersing themselves in a stylistic and visually pleasing environment. Through 3D assets and custom animations, users will go through five handcrafted "stages," participating in two sushi-making lessons that involve slicing fish for nigiri and forming and presenting nigiri. The project's pillars are centered around accurate hand-tracking interactions, a light-hearted tone, an educational experience about Japanese sushi-making, and captivating aesthetics.

 - **Lessons Learned**

The development of this VR experience taught me valuable lessons about creating immersive hand-tracking interactions that feel natural and intuitive to users. I learned the importance of user testing and iteration to refine gameplay mechanics and ensure a seamless user experience. Additionally, working with Quest 2 hand tracking introduced me to new challenges and possibilities, encouraging me to explore innovative ways of integrating this technology into future projects.

- **Successes + Achievements**

One of the most gratifying aspects of this VR project was witnessing users interact with the custom slicing mechanics. Observing their delight as they sliced fish for nigiri and formed sushi with their own hands validated the effort we put into creating engaging and enjoyable interactions. The positive user feedback and excitement for the light-hearted storyline confirmed that I successfully achieved my goal of making learning about Japanese sushi-making a fun and immersive experience.

- **Areas for Improvement**

The late start to the project impacted the development timeline, making it more challenging to incorporate certain features I initially planned. Better time management and planning would be crucial for future projects to avoid such delays.
