  instructions:
  - Alright rookie, it's time to prepare nigiri!
  - We only have a few hours left before our <color=red>Esteemed Guest</color> arrives!
    No time to waste!
  - Pick up the <color=red>Yanagiba</color> knife rookie!
  - That's not the right knife cowboy! I said <color=red>Yanagiba</color>!
  - Good. We will start with salmon, a true classic, and one of our <color=red>Esteemed
    Guest's</color> favourites.
  - Grab a <color=red>Salmon Fillet</color> over there and let's see if you remember
    what you learned at the Academy
